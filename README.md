# Features
Pluto is a basic read-only viewer for
[Kerberos keytab files](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/basic/keytab_def.html).
The file parser is written in javascript and has no external dependencies.

# Possible Upcoming Features
Things are fairly "bare bones" to get started. Feel free to suggest
enhancements. Updates I'm currently considering include:
 * removing records;
 * reordering records.
