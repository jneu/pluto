# Features
Pluto is a viewer for [Kerberos keytab files](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-devel/doc/basic/keytab_def.html).
The file parser is written in javascript and has no dependencies.

# Possible Upcoming Features
Feel free to suggest enhancements. Updates I'm currently considering include:
 * removing records;
 * reordering records.
